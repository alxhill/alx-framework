# ALX-FRAMEWORK

Welcome the alx-framework. Currently this is a very basic work in progress - there is a LOT that needs doing. But it works!

## Features
* URL routing - /controller/method/optional/arguments
* get and post filtering - /controller/method is accessible through get\_method and post\_method
* Functional views that allow data to be passed to them through arrays
* Uses PHP ActiveRecord for models

## To do
* ERROR HANDLING - potentially an exceptions class so the whole thing doesn't just send out server errors all over the place.
* Templates for views, maybe even themes
* Better code organisation etc
